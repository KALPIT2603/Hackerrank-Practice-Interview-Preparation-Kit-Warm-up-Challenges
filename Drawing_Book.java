/* Drawing Book
Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their -page book to page number . Brie can either start
turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page
number ), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at
once). When she opens the book, page 1 is always on the right side:
Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front
side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for
additional diagrams).
Given and , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page .
# Input Format
The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of pages in the book.
The second line contains an integer, , denoting the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to.*/
